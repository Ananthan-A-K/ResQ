SafeAhead - Python MVP


Overview
--------
This repository contains a minimal Python implementation of the SafeAhead MVP:
- A lightweight backend (Flask) that polls public feeds (USGS for earthquakes, Open-Meteo for weather), generates simple alerts, and caches guidance.
- A CLI client that fetches alerts and caches them locally for offline use.


Run locally (development):
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Start the backend (from backend/ directory):


python app.py


This will start a poller thread that checks USGS and Open-Meteo every 60 seconds.


3. Run the CLI client (in a separate terminal):


python cli.py


Notes & Next steps
------------------
- Replace MONITOR_COORD and MONITOR_RADIUS_KM with the region of interest or make them configurable via environment variables or API.
- Add authentication for client calls and rate-limiting.
- Improve alert deduplication and add user preference filters (distance, severity, event types).
- Add richer offline storage for map tiles and localized instructions.
- Integrate push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for mobile builds.
