Start the Backend

From inside the backend folder:

python app.py


You should see something like:

 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)


The backend will:

Poll USGS for earthquakes

Poll Open-Meteo for severe weather

Cache alerts & guidance into a local SQLite database

5️⃣ Run the CLI Client

Open a new terminal, activate the same virtual environment, then:

cd client
python cli.py


The CLI will:

Try to fetch live alerts from http://127.0.0.1:5000/alerts

Cache them in ~/.safeahead_cache.json

If the backend is offline, it shows the last cached alerts.

6️⃣ Try It Out

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/alerts in a browser to see JSON alerts.

Stop the backend (Ctrl+C) and run the CLI again to see offline mode using the cached data.
