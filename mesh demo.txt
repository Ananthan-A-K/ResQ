Absolutely! Let’s make this **step-by-step** so you can demonstrate your Disaster Management Assistant app effectively on a laptop (or multiple devices if available). I’ll break it down into **all features**: SOS, direct messages, broadcast alerts, pending messages, ACKs, online/offline behavior, and alert feeds.

---

## **1. Setup**

1. Open **two or more terminals** (or run on multiple laptops in the same LAN).
2. Start the app with **unique node IDs**:

```bash
python dmasst_fixed_with_sos.py --id node1 --label Alice
python dmasst_fixed_with_sos.py --id node2 --label Bob
```

* `--id` is unique per instance.
* `--label` is human-friendly.

3. (Optional) Provide an **alert feed URL** using `--feed <url>` for live demonstration.

---

## **2. Demonstrate Broadcast Messages**

1. In node1 terminal:

```text
/send ALERT Flood warning near riverbank
```

2. Node2 should **receive** the broadcast immediately:

```
[recv] new msg ...
[ack] sent ack ...
[relay] relayed ...
```

* Check messages: `/list messages` on both nodes.

**Explanation:** This shows **broadcast messaging + automatic relay + ACK**.

---

## **3. Demonstrate Directed (Private) Messages**

1. In node1 terminal:

```text
/send MSG@node2 Hello Bob, this is Alice!
```

2. Node2 **receives** it, but any other nodes **ignore it**.

* Use `/list messages` to see that `dest_id` is recorded correctly.

**Explanation:** This demonstrates **targeted messaging**.

---

## **4. Demonstrate SOS Alerts**

1. In node1 terminal:

```text
/send SOS Need immediate assistance at location X
```

2. SOS messages are **immediately relayed** to all nodes without delay.
3. Node2 sees the SOS and **sends an ACK automatically**.

* Node1 prints:

```
[sos-resend] resent SOS ... (attempt 1)
[ack-recv] message ... acknowledged by node2
```

4. If a node **goes offline** before ACK, SOS messages are **resent automatically** up to MAX retries (`6`).

**Explanation:** Demonstrates **SOS prioritization, retries, and ACK handling**.

---

## **5. Pending / Unacknowledged Messages**

1. Use `/pending` to show **messages that haven’t been forwarded or acknowledged**.
2. Disconnect a node (simulate offline), send messages, reconnect, and show how **pending messages are automatically forwarded**.

**Explanation:** Shows **offline-first behavior and store-and-forward**.

---

## **6. Alerts / Feed Fetching**

1. Provide a live JSON feed URL at startup:

```bash
python dmasst_fixed_with_sos.py --id node1 --label Alice --feed https://example.com/alert.json
```

2. After `30s` (poll interval), `/list alerts` shows fetched alerts.

**Explanation:** Demonstrates **online monitoring and automatic alert fetching**.

---

## **7. Manual ACK Demonstration**

1. Pick a message ID (from `/list messages`).
2. Send an ACK manually:

```text
/ack <message_id>
```

* Verify that the **origin node marks it as acknowledged**.

**Explanation:** Shows **manual ACKs in addition to auto ACKs**.

---

## **8. Cleanup / Expiry**

* Messages older than **7 days** are removed automatically with `cleanup_expired()` (for demonstration, you could reduce the TTL temporarily).

**Explanation:** Shows **database maintenance**.

---

## **9. Demonstration Tips**

* **Multiple terminals/laptops** make it more realistic.
* **Disconnect/reconnect network** to show offline-first message handling.
* **Send multiple SOS messages** to show **retries and acknowledgement handling**.
* Use `/list messages` and `/list alerts` often to visualize state.

If you want, I can **prepare a short demo script with commands and expected output** for **all features** so you can run it like a real presentation in 5–10 minutes.

Do you want me to prepare that?
