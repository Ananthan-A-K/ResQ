Run instructions

Create a new folder, place app.py, the templates folder, and the static folder as above.

Create and activate a virtualenv (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
pip install flask flask-cors


Run:

python app.py


Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

Click on the map to add a shelter. If your browser is offline, the form still works and the shelter is saved to a pending queue in localStorage. When you reconnect to the internet, queued shelters are automatically posted to the Flask API and appear on the shared map.

The map loads cached assets via the service worker so the app shell can load offline (once the service worker is installed).
